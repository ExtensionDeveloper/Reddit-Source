# Reddit-Source
This Chrome extension allows you to quickly access the Reddit source for a particular page's content. Simply right-click on the extension icon or anywhere on the page, then select the 'Refresh page and open Reddit source in a new tab' option from the context menu. This will refresh the current tab and retrieve the Reddit source, which will be opened in a new tab. 

Please note that the page refresh may have unintended consequences, such as resetting the list of content you are currently viewing. If this is a concern, consider opening the content you want to see the Reddit source for in a new tab to preserve your place in the content list. 

This extension uses a background script and a content script to run on pages with a specific URL pattern and includes icons for different sizes.

Here is a quick step by step directions on how to download and install an "unpacked extension" into your Chrome based browser (eg. Opera, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Chromium, etc.)
